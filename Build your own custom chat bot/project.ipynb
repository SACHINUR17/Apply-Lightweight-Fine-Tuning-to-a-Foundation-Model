    "#### Data Source: \n",
    "`character_descriptions.csv` - this file contains character descriptions from theater, television, and film productions. Each row contains the name, description, medium, and setting. All characters were invented by an OpenAI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasoning for selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen for this project, containing character descriptions from theater, television, and film productions, is particularly appropriate for several reasons. Firstly, the characters within this dataset are invented by an OpenAI model, ensuring that they are unique and unlikely to be pre-existing entities within the knowledge base of a large language model (LLM). Consequently, directly querying the LLM about these characters without additional context would be ineffective and inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will generate embeddings for the character descriptions, allowing us to retrieve relevant context based on the userâ€™s query. This context will be incorporated into a custom prompt, enabling the LLM to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. By leveraging this method, we enhance the LLM's ability to handle inquiries about these specific, unique characters, ultimately improving the quality and relevance of the generated answers."
